Amazon Sagemaker Jupyter Notebook - Summary and Meta Summary Generation
This Python code is designed to run in a Jupyter notebook in Amazon Sagemaker. It generates a summary and meta summary of a given book or text. The code is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

boto3: The AWS SDK for Python, used to interact with AWS services such as Amazon S3 and Amazon Comprehend.
nltk: The Natural Language Toolkit, used for tokenizing text.
openai: The OpenAI API, used to generate summaries of text.
Configuration and Dependencies
Before running the code, you'll need to configure the following constants and dependencies:

bucket_name: The name of the S3 bucket where the input file is stored and where the output file and meta summaries will be uploaded.
s3_filename: The name of the input file to be summarized.
openai.api_key: Your OpenAI API key.
comprehend: The AWS Comprehend client, used to detect sentiment and named entities in the text.
In addition, you'll need to have the following dependencies installed:

boto3
nltk
openai
Running the Code
Once you've configured the constants and dependencies, you can run the code in a Jupyter notebook in Amazon Sagemaker. The code performs the following steps:

Reads the original file from S3.
Tokenizes the text using the NLTK library.
Splits the tokens into chunks of 750.
Processes each chunk and generates a chunk summary.
Analyzes sentiment and sentiment scores for each chunk summary.
Detects named entities (names and places) for each chunk summary.
Creates a meta summary for each group of 4 chunk summaries.
Saves each meta summary as a separate text file and uploads it to S3.
Saves the summary and meta summary data as a CSV file and uploads it to S3.
Note that the code is specific to Amazon Sagemaker and may need to be adapted to run on other platforms.
